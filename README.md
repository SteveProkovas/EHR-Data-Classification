# EHR Data Classification

## Overview

This project aims to develop robust machine learning models for classifying Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. The goal is to predict specific outcomes or conditions based on patient data available in EHR datasets. The project includes modules for data preprocessing, advanced feature engineering, model training, comprehensive evaluation, and interpretation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Implement sophisticated feature engineering techniques tailored to EHR data, such as time-series analysis, sequence modeling, or embedding representations.
- **Model Training**: Build machine learning model pipelines using scikit-learn, supporting various algorithms including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM. Hyperparameter tuning and ensemble learning are also supported.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, and confusion matrix. Advanced interpretation tools include feature importances and SHAP values.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale EHR datasets efficiently through optimized preprocessing and model training pipelines.

## Usage

1. **Prepare Data**: Place your EHR dataset in the `data/raw` directory.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Run `preprocessing.py` to preprocess the raw data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Modify or run `feature_engineering.py` to engineer additional features if needed.
4. **Model Training**: Run `model.py` to train machine learning models on the preprocessed data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Use `evaluation.py` to evaluate the performance of trained models and interpret results.

## Techniques

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with advanced hyperparameter tuning techniques such as RandomizedSearchCV or Bayesian optimization for optimizing model performance.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Implement techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using class-weighting strategies to handle imbalanced classes in the dataset.
- **Model Interpretation**: Utilize advanced interpretation techniques such as LIME or SHAP explanations for individual predictions, especially for complex models like ensemble or deep learning models.
